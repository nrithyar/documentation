# Working With Github Pages

The [FAQ](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) maintained by Github covers most stumbling blocks, some other tips and tricks supplied here. 

## Gitignore

Add `_site` to `.gitignore`. The generated site should not be uploaded to Github since its gets generated by github.

## Working With Code Partials

It might be the case that you are able to eval your code on the browser (javascript, css, html). If you can, it is nice to provide example code and also, working examples. You can DRY up your code samples and keep them easily up to date with the following strategy.

You want to start with file structure that has an `_includes` directory where you will put your snippets, and a markdown file that will be parsed into your github page. "includes" are analogous to partials.

    ├── _includes
    │   ├── alert_msg.js
    ├── index.markdown

and some js in your snippet.

```javascript
  alert("hello world");
```
and include that snippet in your markdown for it to be picked up by pygments and rendered into HTML:
    
Now create the working example by evaling the partial.


## Keeping documentation up to date

Having the `gh-pages` convention is nice, but it keeps it hard to share between to branches and this is a problem if you want to publish your documentation. A simple solution is to provide a post-commmit hook that clones the repo into a temp directory, generates the documentation, copies that documentation into that branch and then pushes the code to the gh-pages branch on your github remote; triggering the page build process.
